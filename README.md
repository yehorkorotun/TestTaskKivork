# Task
1) How would you handle a StaleElementReferenceException? Please provide a code fragment or fragments, if you know about several common ways of handling.

2)  Go to https://freegeoip.io/ and get a free API key (be aware that it is limited to 100 requests / mo). Call their API with that key, using JSON format, and perform the following actions:
a) Assert the response code;
b) Parse the response;
c) Assert your latitude and longitude with a 0.01Â° tolerance (assume you know your actual lat and lon).

3) Provide a code fragment that switches the current browser to another tab (consider there are only 2 tabs). Please comment on the code in detail.

4)  Imagine the following scenario: you click on a button that should redirect you to a new page, but the page URL stays the same and the DOM structure stays almost the same. Provide a code fragment to wait explicitly for the page to unload. Waiting for the page to load is not necessary (perhaps you want to gracefully handle some errors in case you are left on the same page).
